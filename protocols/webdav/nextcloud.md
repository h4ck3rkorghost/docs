## Connecting

### Connection Profiles

:::::{tabs}
::::{group-tab} Nextcloud

Select the connection profile `Nextcloud` for _Protocol_ bundled by default.

::::
::::{group-tab} ownCloud

Select the connection profile `ownCloud` for _Protocol_ bundled by default. 

**ownCloud Infinite Scale (oCIS)**

Connecting to *ownCloud Infinite Scale* the default authentication scheme is OpenID Connect. It requires the client registration in the identity provider in ownCloud via *Keycloak*. Additionally you need a custom [connection profile](https://github.com/iterate-ch/profiles/pull/83/files) to connect.

:::{note}
Basic Authentication is disabled by default. For additional information refer to the [ownCloud documentation](https://doc.owncloud.com/ocis/next/deployment/services/s-list/auth-basic.html).
:::

**Import client configuration for Keycloak**

To test without a custom deployment, use the public instance running at `ocis.ocis-keycloak.latest.owncloud.works` with the identity provider at `keycloak.ocis-keycloak.latest.owncloud.works` (username and password: `admin`).

The client configuration to match the provided connection profile can be imported from the [ownCloud Github repository](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/blob/7af9cd9e53183acbaac2ffbc6414402bdef1f5d4/deployments/examples/ocis_keycloak/config/keycloak/clients/cyberduck.json) to allow OAuth authentications from [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io) & [Mountain Duck](https://mountainduck.io).

::::
::::{group-tab} WebDAV

Alternatively you can connect using `WebDAV (HTTPS)` with the default path set to `/remote.php/webdav/`.

::::
:::::


:::{tip}
The default path `/remote.php/dav/files/<username>` will be used with no custom setting in _Path_ to access the WebDAV API.
:::

:::{attention}
You are required to set a _Path_ only if your installation is accessible under a subdirectory such as `example.net/cloud/` this can be indicated by setting a default path of `directory/remote.php/webdav`. You can omit the value in _Path_ if your installation defaults to the root of your domain and is accessible at `example.net/remote.php/dav/files/<username>`. 
:::

### Obtain WebDAV Address From Server

Connect to your Nextcloud or ownCloud server in your web browser and obtain the WebDAV address from _Settings_ in the lower left. Paste the copied server address into the *Server* field and finish editing. From the pasted URL the hostname is set in _Server_ and the document root of your Nextcloud or ownCloud installation in _Path_.

:::{warning}
Make sure to set in _Username_ the actual username instead of the email address.
:::

### 2-Factor Authentication

With 2-factor authentication enabled, you will need to create an app password instead of your regular login credentials. You should find it in *Personal → App passwords*.

## Features

### Versioning

A list of file versions can be viewed in the *Versions* tab of the *[Info](../../cyberduck/info.md#versions)* window. Files can be reverted to a chosen version of this list. 

### Share & Request Files

Create different [shares](../../cyberduck/share.md#nextcloud--owncloud) using the context menu. By adding a passphrase in the corresponding you can build a password protected share. Alternatively skip the prompt to create a public share.

![Nextcloud Share Passphrase](_images/Nextcloud_Share_Passphrase.png)

- Use *File → Request files…* to create upload shares for folders.

- Use *File → Share…* to create download shares. Choose between a public link by selecting `Everyone` and a privat link for another user by choosing a specific email address. The user will be notified about the shared file by email.

### Resumable Uploads

Connecting to *ownCloud Infinite Scale*, interrupted uploads can be resumed at any time.

:::{note}
Cyberduck 8.9.0 or later is required.
:::

## Known Limitations

### 0-Byte Files

If you are running an Apache configuration make sure to disable `fastcgi` and `php-fpm`. Refer to our [best practice for Nextcloud and ownCloud installations](../../mountainduck/issues/fastcgi.md).

### Modification Date

The modification date retention is supported using `X-OC-Mtime` for new files uploaded but without the option to adjust the modification date later.
